# TRON
Final Project for Artificial Intellegence. Won 93% of games against other intellegent bots and placed in the top percentage of the class. 

The main tron bot code is located in the bots.py within the StudentBot class. Both Alpha-Beta Cutoff and the Voronoi Heuristic were implemented to ensure sucessful bot performance. 

Collaborated with Hannah O'keefe
